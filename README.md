## Project Description
The Shop Rover is a mobile robot project designed to facilitate shopping tasks. It is equipped with a Bluetooth control system allowing intuitive interaction via smartphone. The robot is built on a four-wheel drive robot car base and integrates various sensors and actuators for a complete experience.

## Features
- Remote control via Bluetooth
- Movement in four directions (forward, backward, left, right)
- Lighting system with white and red LEDs
- Ambient light detection via photoresistor
- Sound signal for interaction
- Rechargeable lithium-ion battery power supply

## Hardware Components
The project uses the following components:
- Four-wheel drive robot car chassis
- Arduino Uno R3 board
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- L293D motor driver
- INR18650 â€“ 2000mAh Lithium battery
- White and red LEDs
- Photoresistor (LDR)
- Buzzer

For more details about the components, check the [Hardware README](hardware/README.md).
